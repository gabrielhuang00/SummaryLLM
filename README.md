Hello! This is a personal project I worked on for a few months. At its core, it's a passion project geared towards developing educational software. 

The goal was to implement a google chrome extension that automatically parsed whatever a user was reading (through usage of Google Extension's built in tabs API),
summarize it, and add it to a database of things that I had learned throughout the month.

I was inspired to create this due to my love for learning â€” every day, I read at least three articles. A big problem I discovered was a lack of retention. Ekko
was created to solve that, storing my knowledge and quizzing me (quizzes developed through an LLM as well) at spaced intervals through popups in my chrome tabs.
